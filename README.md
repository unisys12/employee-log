Employee-Log
============

##Intent
The intent of this project is to rewrite an existing application from Laravel 4 to Laravel 5. The reason I am rewriting, instead of just updating the old project, is purely to gain more experience. Not just in development, but deployment and sys admin stuff as well. The domain this project will parked on is hosted on Network Solutions, but the project will reside on servers on Heroku.

##Usage
At this time, well. There is no usage. The project is not done!

But, in time, this project will allow employees/users to track and report their daily mileage and time through a *(hopefully)* friendly web interface. More instructions and/or documentation will be forth coming. You know, like when I finish it!

This project is currently using Laravel v5 Beta. You cannot say that you were not warned!

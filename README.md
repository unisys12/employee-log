Employee-Log
============

##Intent
The intent of this project is to rewrite an existing application from Laravel 4 to Laravel 5. The reason I am rewriting, instead of just updating the old project, is purely to gain more experience. 

##Usage
At this time, well. There is no usage. The project is not done!

But, in time, this project will allow employees/users to track and report their daily mileage and time through a *(hopefully)* friendly web interface. More instructions and/or documentation will be forth coming. You know, like when I finish it!

This project is currently using Laravel v5 Beta. You cannot say that you were not warned!
